	Command: [image path] [image name]
-Save Project: Saves currently loaded project as a project that can be reopened via the Load command. 
	Command: [project path] [project name]
-Add Image to Layer: Adds an image to the currently loaded layer.
	Command: [image path] [x-coord] [y-coord]
-Add Layer: Creates a new layer as user-specified name. Also adds a layer button to the left panel.
	Command: add-layer [layer name]
-Quit: quits the image processor
	Command: quit

-Green Component: Applies filter that applies the green pixel component.
	Command: set-filter green-component
-Red Component: Applies filter that applies the red pixel component.
	Command: set-filter red-component
-Brighten Intensity: Applies filter that changes pixel value to according to intensity.
	Command: set-filter brighten-intensity

	Command: set-filter normal

Layer Buttons:
-Each layer button is added when a new layer is created. When pressed, the current layer becomes that layer.


Image Processor Example:
//Creates a new 500x500 project
new-project 500 500

//Creates a new layer called layer1
add-layer layer1

//Adds an image to layer1 at (50, 25)
add-image-to-layer path/dog.ppm 50 25

//Applies the green component filter to layer1
set-filter green-component

//Applies the brighten intensity filter to layer1
set-filter brighten-intensity

//Saves the image
save-image path/dog.ppm dogimage

//Saves the project
save-project path/dog.ppm dogproject

//Quits the image processor
quit

//Loads the dogproject project into the image processor
load path/dog.ppm dogproject
